# Homework 1
We have implemented the first part of this home work(Sequence Generation) in Java and the next two sections(Sequence Partitioning and Sequence assembler) in C++. Following are the steps to run all three parts-  

- Navigate to the hw1 folder and run the following command  

make all  

This will create all the necessary class files   

For Sequence partitioning run the following command  

java -jar hw1-1.jar 500 25 25 25 25 10 0.005 outputfile  

Now outputfile will have 10 sequences  

For the Sequence partitioning part run the following command   

./hw1-2 outputfile 100 150 out2  

For the Sequence Assembler part run the following command    

./hw1-3 out2 1 -1 -3 out3
