## Abstract

Extraction of meaningful patterns from huge biological data is termed as motif search. Identification of structural and sequence motifs in genomic sequences is gaining much attention today.  Ribonucleic acid or RNA is one of the important bio molecule whose secondary structure defines its functionality. In this project I aim to Implement two methods for motif identification in a set of RNA sequences and comparing the result in terms of performance and accuracy.

1. Implementing the method for motif identification in a set of RNA using swarm optimization technique and comparing it result with other existing methods like GeRNAMO and GPRM etc.
2. Implementing another novel approach for finding motifs in unaligned structure by using the Fourier transform and the so called motif identification algorithm.

## Plan of action

- Understanding various motif Identification methods.
- Understanding the swarm optimization algorithm.
- Implementing both the algorithm.
- Comparing the results of the algorithm with the existing methods GeRNAMo and GPRM etc.
- Any biological sequence can be used to perform these analyses.
- Performance and accuracy analysis of the algorithm with respect to the GeRNMo and GPRM for few biological sequences and system parameters.


## Distribution of workload

Workload will be divided equally among the team members
